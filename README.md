# Estimate parameters of mixtures of logistic regressions

This code is one applied part in the PhD thesis of [Mor-Absa Loum](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/mor-absa-loum-3372aa73)

## Description

Mixture of lOgistic Regressions Parameters (H)Estimation with (U)Spectral methods.
The main methods take d-dimensional inputs + a vector of binary outputs, and return
parameters according to the GLMs mixture model (please see the package vignette).

NOTE: greek unicode letters are used in the code, because it's much nicer to write λ, β
and Σ than lambda, beta and Sigma - and also more importantly because it works well :)
...However CRAN demands ASCII files - therefore the presence of to-cran.sh script.

## Example

Install the package, then ?multiRun is a possible starting point.
